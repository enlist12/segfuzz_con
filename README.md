# SegFuzz: Segmentizing thread interleaving to discover concurrency bugs in a kernel through fuzzing

This is a research prototype to discover kernel concurrency bugs using
an interleaving coverage metric. The major components of this project
are two, interleaving segment coverage and mutation-based thread
interleaving exploration.
